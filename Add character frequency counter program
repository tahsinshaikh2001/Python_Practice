This Python program counts the frequency of each character in a user-provided string. It demonstrates the use of dictionaries and loops to store and update counts dynamically.

**Features**

Takes string input from the user.

Counts the number of times each character appears.

Works for letters, numbers, spaces, and special characters.

Prints the frequency in dictionary format.


n = input("Enter here: ")
f = {}
for i in n:
    if i in f:
        f[i] += 1
    else:
        f[i] = 1
print(f)


**How It Works**

The user inputs a string.

An empty dictionary is created to store character counts.

The program loops through each character in the string:

If the character already exists in the dictionary, its count is increased by 1.

If it is the first occurrence, it is added to the dictionary with a count of 1.

Finally, the program prints the dictionary with all character frequencies.
